# Prediction Market

## Project Description

The Prediction Market is a decentralized smart contract platform built on Ethereum that allows users to create prediction markets on future events and outcomes. Users can create markets with multiple betting options, place bets with Ether, and claim winnings based on resolved outcomes. The platform operates in a trustless manner where market resolution is handled by contract administrators, and winnings are automatically calculated and distributed proportionally to winning bets.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize prediction markets by removing traditional barriers and intermediaries. We aim to create a transparent, accessible, and fair platform where anyone can create markets on future events, from sports outcomes to political elections, and participate in collective intelligence gathering through financial incentives. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure transparency, immutability, and automatic execution of payouts without requiring trust in centralized authorities.

## Key Features

### 🏗️ **Market Creation**
- **Flexible Market Setup**: Users can create prediction markets with custom questions and multiple outcome options
- **Time-Bound Markets**: Each market has a defined end time after which no new bets can be placed
- **Multi-Option Support**: Support for binary (Yes/No) and multi-choice prediction markets

### 💰 **Betting System**
- **Minimum Bet Protection**: Enforced minimum bet amount (0.01 ETH) to prevent spam
- **Proportional Payouts**: Winnings calculated based on bet proportion relative to winning pool
- **Real-time Pool Tracking**: Live tracking of total bets and individual option pools

### 🎯 **Market Resolution**
- **Administrative Resolution**: Contract owner resolves markets with winning outcomes
- **Automatic Payout Calculation**: Smart contract automatically calculates winning amounts
- **Claim-based Distribution**: Winners must claim their rewards to receive payouts

### 🔒 **Security & Transparency**

## Core Functions

1. **createMarket()** - Create new prediction markets with custom parameters
2. **placeBet()** - Place bets on market outcomes with Ether
3. **resolveMarket()** - Resolve markets and set winning outcomes (admin only)
4. **claimWinnings()** - Claim proportional winnings from resolved markets

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the contract to your preferred Ethereum network
2. Create prediction markets using `createMarket()`
3. Users can place bets using `placeBet()` before market end time
4. Admin resolves markets using `resolveMarket()`
5. Winners claim rewards using `claimWinnings()`

## Security Considerations

- All functions include proper access controls and validation
- Reentrancy protection implemented for fund transfers
- Time-based restrictions prevent betting after market closure
- Comprehensive event logging for transparency and debugging
